Welcome to my university python project.


There's a few things you need to do for set up:

Step 1: Make sure you have python installed on the system.

Step 2: Run the command 'python -m venv venv'

Step 3: for windows run: venv/Scripts/activate (for windows)
        for linux or macOS run: source  venv/bin/activate 

Step 4: now run pip install -r requirements.txt; This should install all the requirements 

Step 5: once the requirements are installed you can now run the project. Type 'flask run'
